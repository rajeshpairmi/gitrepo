 there are 3 directories
 - working directory
 - tracking or staging directory
 - Commit directory

 working directory:
 This will show the working files, which are work in progress

 Staging directory:
 once the file is ready to commit, file should be sent to the staging directory.
 staging directory will index the file to ensure file has a unique reference.

 Command: git add 
 
 How to unstage the file in staging directory?
 we can use git rm --cached <file> to remove the file from staging area.

 to stage multiple files we use git add .

 file -- > Indexing(Commit ID) --> Storage location(local)
 once file is in storage location then for the backup and collaboration we can move the file to central location
 Storage location (local repository) --> remote repository

 Commit directory:
 This is the local storage repository.
 It creates the base 
 git commit -m(message) "added first commit"

 For the first commit, git should understand who the user is.
 git config --global user.email "<rajeshparimi@gmail.com>"
 git config --global user.name "rajeshparimi"

 This helps to commit a file in working area which is indexed at staging area into the local repository.

 git show - will show th commits with commit ID, Author, email.
 git ls-files - lists the files available in staging area.
 git status - will show the untracked files
 git log - will display all the commits in the commit area

 git log --oneline
